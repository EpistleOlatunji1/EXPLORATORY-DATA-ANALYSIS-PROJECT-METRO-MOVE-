Project Overview

MetroMove Transit Solutions operates buses, trains, ferries, and trams across multiple cities, aiming to provide efficient, affordable, and timely public transportation.
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights that can optimize scheduling, reduce costs, and enhance the passenger experience.

Objectives

Analyze demand patterns across routes and peak hours
Identify service delays and reliability issues
Explore ridership trends by transport mode
Highlight operational inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement

Dataset
Source: (Add dataset link or description here)
Contents: Trip records, ridership counts, delays, routes, and service schedules
Size: (Add number of rows, columns, or file size once known)
 Methods
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Descriptive statistics
Visualization of demand and ridership trends
Delay and reliability analysis
Correlation and comparative analysis

Key Insights

Peak demand occurs during weekday commuting hours
Certain routes are overcrowded while others are underutilized
Delays cluster around specific times and routes
Ferries show seasonal ridership patterns compared to buses and trains

 Next Steps

Develop predictive models for ridership forecasting
Design optimization strategies for scheduling and resource allocation
Integrate passenger feedback data for service quality improvement
Explore real-time monitoring for dynamic scheduling
